- data is everywhere
- not all data is important

- album
    - album title
    - temperature on release day
    - favorite pet
    - year of release
    - number of albums sold
    - producer
    - number of songs

- data information and knowledge wisdom

- databases are everywhere

- normalization of data (rules to store the data into the database)
- purpose of normalization
    - clean up data
    - ensure a proper structure
    - data consistency
    - enhances search of data
    - increase quality of data (reliable)


- 1N (FIRST NORMAL FORM)
    - only "one of each" in each column
    - unique identification of each row

- 2N (SECOND NORMAL FORM)
    - remove redundancy (repetition) of data in rows
    - many to one

        students (many)                 classes (one)
         - id                            - id
         - class_id                      - class
         - name
         - address
         - zip
         - city

    - one student can have many students
    - one student can only be in one class

- 3N (THIRD NORMAL FORM)
    - only columns with direct dependency of the primary keys shall be in the entity
    - primary key (unique id)

        students (many)                 classes (one)           zip_city
         - id                            - id                    - zip
         - class_id                      - class                 - city
         - name
         - address
         - zip

- Datatypes

    Datatype            Meaning                             Example
    - INT               Integer (whole numbers)             42
    - DECIMAL           Floating point number               42.1
    - DATETIME          Date and time in one                12.24.2013 18:59:59
    - VARCHAR           String (text)                       Neils


Relations
    - one to many
    - many to many
    - many to one

- from database model to database design
    - create foreign keys
    - enter datatypes
    - many to many relations resolved into intermediate table
